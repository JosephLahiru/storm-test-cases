# This script defines the Blizzard class. 
# A blizzard is a severe winter storm characterized by strong winds, low visibility, and heavy snow. 
# The Blizzard class inherits from the Storm class, which defines the basic properties of a storm, such as its name and wind speed. 
# The Blizzard class adds additional properties, such as the blizzard's temperature.

# The Blizzard class has two methods: calculate_classification() and get_advice(). 
# The calculate_classification() method calculates the blizzard's classification, such as "Blizzard", "Severe Blizzard", or "Snow Storm". 
# The get_advice() method returns advice for how to stay safe during a blizzard.
